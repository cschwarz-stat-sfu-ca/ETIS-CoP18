The original development of the R code was funded by the [UK Government's Darwin Initiative](https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/the-darwin-initiative)
project [17-020 Enhancing the Elephant Trade Information System to Guide CITES policy](http://www.darwininitiative.org.uk/project/17020/) whilst the authors were working at the [University of Reading](http://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/maths/Case_study_-_Maths_-_Elephants.pdf). 

Development of the code for future analyses has been funded by the European Union and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service's [African Elephant Conservation Fund](https://www.fws.gov/international/wildlife-without-borders/african-elephant-conservation-fund.html). 

The governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and the European Union funded the work to make the code available on-line.
